As a result, we are hosting a special contest for all students enrolled in android! The first student to open a succesfull PR with the changes we have described to them will have their PR accepted (provided they take care of all the little things like .gitignore). Students of Android development at MUJ ACM SCHAP only have to make a default Hello world app, push it on github and submit a PR to get their code added here!

## Requirements

### Prerequisites
Every student pursuing this course should have basic Java knowledge. This includes knowing basic data structures like arrays, linked list and some pre-defined classes (Knowledge in Array lists, hash maps etc. is a plus).

- [Download here](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
- [Installation instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)    

Students are required to have the IDE setup before attending any classes. Please make sure the IDE is working properly and has all the necessary tools installed. This is the only software needed for this course.

### Devices and Accessories
Students should carry the following devices and accessories every class -
- A laptop with the software mentioned above installed
- An android mobile device
