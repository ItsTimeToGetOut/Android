Firstly, Thank you for reading this! This means you are here, ready to contribute to this repository. We at MUJ ACM SCHAP truly want everyone of you to become good developers and coders. Contributing on github is an important step for that!

So, what brought you here today?
* Found an issue or bug in this repo? 
  * First, look under the [Issues](https://github.com/MUJ-ACM-SCHAP/Android/issues) to make sure it has not been reported yet.
  * If not, [start a new issue](https://github.com/MUJ-ACM-SCHAP/Android/issues/new) and properly describe what problems you found and (if the issue is a bug in any code here), how to reproduce the issue.
  * Try to fix the issue yourself if you can by following the steps below!

* Want to fix an open issue? Wow! That's great! 
  * Firstly, go to [Issues](https://github.com/MUJ-ACM-SCHAP/Android/issues) and comment on the issue stating your intention to fix it. This assures that we dont have multiple people working on the same issue only to have duplicated their effort. 
  * Then, [Fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [clone your copy to your PC](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).
  * Make all the changes you want to make in your local copy and [commit them](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github#make-changes-locally). Now, update local changes to your repo by [pushing the changes](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/). 
  * Now comes the easy part - go to github and open your repository. You will see the option to create a new pull request. Click on that and [make a new pull request](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github#create-pull-request) to our repository from yours. 
  * Assign [@yashovardhan99](https://github.com/orgs/MUJ-ACM-SCHAP/people/yashovardhan99) as the reviewer (only for the android repository) to ensure faster review and merging of your changes! That's it!

* Want to add to this repository like by adding your own project samples? That's awesome!!
  * First, fork this repo and clone it on your PC. 
   * Next, add the project files in a seperate directory in the `Examples` directory (like `Examples/Calculator` for a calculator app). 
   * Add a [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Android.gitignore) file and then commit all files (adding .gitignore before commiting ensures that files in the .gitignore are ignored by git).
   * Now, push your repository by using `git push orign [branch_name]`
   * Lastly, go to github and make a pull request to get those changes updated on our repo!
   
If you do end up making a pull request, be sure to keep an eye out for any reviews that may request you to make any changes before the PR is merged.

Thank you for contributing to this repository! You are doing a great thing and this helps you learn the basics of git which will be really really useful for you!
